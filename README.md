# ShooFun

It's a shopping website for people who likes to shop online, this site provides all kinds of products with affordable prices.

## Motivation
I don't have that much experience in the backend field, so I want to improve myself by making this web app.

With this I can also explore many things regarding the backend world, and learn new things. I will be trying out a lot of stuff in this project, like new libraries and such.
